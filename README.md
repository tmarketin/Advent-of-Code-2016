Day 5:

Bash script accepts starting and ending number, and iterates from "$string" + starting number to "$string" + ending number, gets the MD5 hash and compares the first five characters to "00000". 

Option "-n" in echo removes the trailing newline and pipes the string into md5sum program. 

C++ version is significantly faster, it uses the OpenSSL MD5 function.

Day 8:

Not particularly elegant, but hopefully readable code. It uses the \<chrono\> and \<thread\> libraries for pausing every 50 miliseconds, and changes color of the output while drawing the screen after each command. 

day8.dat is a slightly modified version of the original input for easier parsing and reading. 

Day 9:
Recursive version is _significantly_ faster.
